Create Lab03.html file. Write React Code to do the following.

You will display the following cities in a table.

France, Paris
India, New Delhi
Israel, Telaviv
Lisbon, Portugal

Now, This is what you need to do

1) You will store these cities in an array and display them in a table dynamically. :)
2) If the city name begins with the letter 'P' the background color of the item will be blue in color

Hint: Construct an Array of JSX elements

Note: We'll rewite this code later in a Component style.
